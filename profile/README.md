# Welcome to The ALANA Project

### Vision & Mission
**The ALANA Project** is a diverse community that empowers creators and builders by guiding them into the decentralized world of the future. We achieve this through a multi-pronged approach by fostering a supportive and inclusive community, freely accessible educational resources, and collectively built products that educate in a fun and entertaining way on all interconnected topics of the onchain world. The products built within the community are a core part of creating a circular economy within and beyond the community.
