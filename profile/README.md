# Vision & Mission
**The ALANA Project** is a diverse community that empowers creators and builders by guiding them into the decentralized world of the future. We achieve this through a multi-pronged approach by fostering a supportive and inclusive community, freely accessible educational resources, and collectively built products that educate in a fun and entertaining way on all interconnected topics of the onchain world. The products built within the community are a core part of creating a circular economy within and beyond the community.

# Impact
The impact we aim to have is two-fold:

- By lowering the barriers to entry and ensuring a clear understanding of why onchain technology can empower creators and builders, we help increase the overall adoption of these technologies. This will help them realize their full potential by utilizing the tools to their advantage and creating even more innovative use cases.
- The second layer of impact comes from the research and development for The ALANA Project as a decentralized organization. We do investigative research and build social-layer tools and resources to foster community interactions along a healthy and balanced growth sentiment.

# Organizational Structure
Originally, stellaachenbach created ALANA as a 3D avatar to give a face to the Web3 Revolution. As ALANA grew more popular among fellow designers and creators, stellaachenbach decided to utilize this attraction to evolve the once personal project into something more meaningful. Since then, and with the support of many contributors and partners, it has transitioned from a very centralized project to a continuously decentralized one run by various members of ALANA's community.
