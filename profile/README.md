# Vision & Mission
**The ALANA Project** is a diverse community that empowers creators and builders by guiding them into the decentralized world of the future. We achieve this through a multi-pronged approach by fostering a supportive and inclusive community, freely accessible educational resources, and collectively built products that educate in a fun and entertaining way on all interconnected topics of the onchain world. The products built within the community are a core part of creating a circular economy within and beyond the community.

# Impact
The impact we aim to have is three-fold:

1. By lowering the barriers to entry and ensuring a clear understanding of why onchain technology can empower creators and builders, we help increase the overall adoption of these technologies. This will help them realize their full potential by utilizing the tools to their advantage and creating even more innovative use cases. We do that by creating free, entertaining, and collaborative resources to which we actively invite.
2. Secondly, we are committed to building a self-sustaining community. Therefore, we built high-quality and innovative products in a collaborative way that aims to show tangible use cases for Web3 technology and therefore inspire others to do the same.
3. The third layer of impact comes from the research and development of The ALANA Project as a decentralized organization. We do investigative research and build social-layer tools and resources to foster community interactions along a healthy and balanced growth sentiment.

# Values
The ALANA Project Community has a clearly designed value structure in the form of a Manifesto to ensure internal alignment that is communicated to new members. The layout of the values was inspired by [Dieter Rams'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) [10 Principles of Good Design](https://www.heurio.co/dieter-rams-10-principles-of-good-design). The ALANA Manifesto will be the primary gate to enter the ALANA Project community to ensure value alignment among the diverse members. It is a [freely mintable NFT]() via an Unlock Protocol-powered smart contract.

# Organizational Structure
Originally, stellaachenbach (founder) created ALANA as a 3D avatar to give a face to the Web3 Revolution. As ALANA grew more popular among fellow designers and creators, stellaachenbach decided to utilize this attraction to evolve the once personal project into something more meaningful. Since then, and with the support of many contributors and partners, it has transitioned from a very centralized project to a continuously decentralized one run by various members of ALANA's community. 
To learn more about the project and how we are organized, we suggest the following:
- **[Take the Web3 LEARNER Journey](https://zealy.io/cw/thealanaproject):** A gamified learner journey that helps with gaining some basic knowledge about Web3 and the ALANA Community.
- **[Understand our Value Alignment](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?id=ed49cb2f-536c-45c6-9232-101abdad33b8):** Read and mint the ALANA Manifesto and understand which values we hold up high.
- **[Mint an Executive Summary about the Work we do](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?id=8f65c770-38a2-4e4e-ac20-7afd37da0525):** The ALANA Codex is a summary of all the meetings we do on a weekly basis. Once you connect with the NFT minted to [Darkblock.io](https://www.darkblock.io/), you will see even more than the sheet summary, such as screenshots, work-in-progress images, etc.
<br/>
ALANA's Manifesto is the base NFT for gaining access to community channels and interactions ( *access criteria coming soon* ). For those who seek to join on a more serious basis, there are three different levels of memberships we have composed and voted on:
